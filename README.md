# Protonmail-Selenium-Exporter
This console app automatically exports all your emails on Protonmail as .eml files using Selenium on Firefox. Therefore Firefox is required in order for this app to work. Depending on the number of mails it can take a while to download all mails on inbox and/or sent items. As a Selenium script it doesn't interfere with any other activities on your computer.

Furthermore, it includes a summary report counting how many mails and how much space are you using by different grouping such as common recipient, common destinatary, by subject and by date. This can be done by itself or it is also included in any download option. The report is print on console  and in a TXT file.
It is advised to set CMD Screen Buffer Size to a large value (Can be quite verbose).
