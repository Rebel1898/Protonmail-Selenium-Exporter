# Protonmail-Selenium-Exporter
This console app automatically exports all your emails on Protonmail as .eml files using Selenium on Firefox. Therefore Firefox is required in order for this app to work. Depending on the number of mails it can take a while to download all mails on inbox and/or sent items. As a Selenium script it doesn't interfere with any other activities on your computer.
